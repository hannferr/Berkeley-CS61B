# My CS61B Learning Journey

This repository contains my personal solutions and work for the homework assignments, labs, and projects from 
UC Berkeley's CS61B: Data Structures course.

I'm using this space primarily to:

*   Track my progress and document my understanding of the material.
*   Practice using Git and GitHub for version control.
*   Build a personal archive of the code I've written.

My goal is to deepen my knowledge of fundamental computer science concepts, data structures, and algorithms through the
curriculum of CS61B. This repository reflects my individual effort and learning process 
throughout the course.
